# Private-Hyperledger-Fabric-Blockchain-network-for-storing-students-records

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my Master's Project, conducted as a part of the requirements for the Master's Degree in Networks and Security of Information Systems at the University of Djillali Liabes Sidi Bel Abbes. The project is dedicated to exploring the applications of blockchain technology in the education sector. Specifically, it involves building a fully custom, private, and permissioned blockchain network as a potential platform for student information systems within the university.

The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Explain the fundamental concepts and components of blockchain technology.
2. Explore the characteristics and functioning of blockchain networks.
3. Investigate different types of blockchain and their respective use cases.
4. Focus on applications and challenges related to implementing blockchain technology in the education sector.
5. Architect and implement solutions on top of the blockchain network to address specific use cases.
